This tab presents planned changes to the game, that has not yet been implemented. Please note that these changes are not certain to go through.

	- Finish up the support tab with facts about the game and instructions on how to play.

	- Use the last "Support" button to  open the webpage for bug reporting.

	- Selecting a preferred character in the Options menu needs to be changed to a list of chars.

	- I have an idea of how to save data on the server, rendering local copies useless.
		- Simply name each .xml file after the user and check that there's only 1 of 
		  that user name. Then save these files in a ''Data'' folder on the server.

	- Fix bugs and balance classes and stats.

	- Add more Epochal Items to the game.
		- One Weapon per class per tier.
		- Change current ones to be Crit based
		- Make new ones Speed based.

	- Add more icons and graphics.

	- Add a BOSS difficulty to choose from.

	- Add more NPCAIs to the game.

	- Implement ''one-battle quests'', where a character will face multiple foes in a 
	  small series of difficult battles.

	- Implement the "Story" - The final objectives of the player.

	- Learn and use the DirectX library to do the following:
		- Add music and sound effects to the game.
		- Add Animations of characters hitting NPCs and vice versa.
	  Currently, DirectX errores during installment on all development computers.

	- Add Buffs and Debuffs to the game.
		- Adjust Abilities so there are more buffing abilities, heal over time or likewise.

	- NAME the game.

	- Change the Thief's Copycat ability. Right now it's only good for being "less carried"
	  in multiplayer.

Known bugs:

	- On computers where the used font is not installed, alot of text scaling errores occur.
	- Using buffs on other characters in a battle causes a wrong hover text.
	- After a character has died in battle, the NPC will carry on attacking that character.
